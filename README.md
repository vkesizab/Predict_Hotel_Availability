# Predict Hotel Availability
Data Science Challenge: Predict Hotel Availability
Travel Express is an online hotel booking agency. They focus on improving the travel experiences of their customers using cutting edge innovations in the field.
<br />
<br />
Travel Express has noticed that customers are not happy with hotels that suddenly become unavailable for booking. A hotel that accepts bookings that throughout the year adds value to the Travel Express Platform. Travel Express has decided to fund the hotels based upon their commitment to yearly availability.

# Problem
<br />
<br />
Perform an analysis of the given data to determine how different features are related to the completion of the analysis. Build a machine learning model that can predict yearly_availability.
<br />
<br />
<br />
For each record in the test set (test.csv) predict the value of the yearly_availability variable (0 or 1). Submit a CSV file with a header row plus ach of the test entriess, each on its own line. The file (submission.csv) should have exactly 2 columns:

<br />
<br />

- id
- yearly_availability (contains 0 or 1)

<br />
<br />
<br />

Deliverables
<br />
- Well commented Jupyter notebook
- "submissions.csv"

<br />
<br />
<br />
Explore the data, make visualizations, and generate new features if required. Make appropriate plots, annotate the notebook with markdowns and explain necessary inferences. A person should be able to read the notebook and understand the steps taken as well as the reasoning behind them. The solution will be graded on the basis of effective visualizations to convey the analyis and the modeling process.
